    <!-- Below is the HTML template for one review. Using the $travel_reviews variable defined above and
    a foreach loop, print all the reviews. You only need one HTML template since the loop goes
    through all reviews.

    The variable contains an indexed array of associate arrays. You should loop through the indexed array
    and access the associative array fields with the square brackets, e.g. $single_review["author"].
